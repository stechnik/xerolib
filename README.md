Library for TAPPS2 making HVAC calculations easier

This .bib library can be added to TAPPS2 the program by Technische Alternative to program their Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) applications.

Currently the library contains a function template for clculating vapour pressure of water in air. The August-Roche-Magnus formula is used therefore.
